# Finite Automata Potion!
This is project 1 for the Theory of Language and Automata course. It's about DFA and NFA and has 2 + 1 parts:
#### Part 0:
Reading the input from a file and storing the given NFA in the desired data structures.
#### Part 1:
Converting the NFA to an equivalent DFA
#### Part 2:
Giving the equivalent regular expression for the DFA produced in the previous part.

## Running The Tests
Every part of the project can be tested using the unit tests provided in the source code.
Almost all the methods have a unit test which can be ran with the desired input.
